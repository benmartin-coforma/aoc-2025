My solutions to Advent of Code 2025.

My language of choice is JS.

My initial solutions are written in the browser console, and can be run there too.
1. Go to [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/).
2. Sign in however you choose.
3. Pick a puzzle and view the input. The page URL will resemble `https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/3/input`
4. Press <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>Control + Shift + i</kbd> to open the console.
5. Paste in the code.
6. Press enter.

If you'd like to make edits,
you may have an easier time using the Firefox console's multiline mode,
or the Chrome Snippets editor,
or your favorite browser's equivalent to those features.
